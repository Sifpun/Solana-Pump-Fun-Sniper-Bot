# Installation
*(You can always put this Readme File into ChatGPT & ask for a Detailed Step-by-Step Installation Tutorial From Scratch if you're new to installing bots.)*

2. Node.js: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.


3. SOL Balance: The ratio we suggest is 1:10, that is, for every 1 SOL you'll use per trade, have 10 SOL in the wallet (so if you're using 0.1 SOL per trade, have 1 SOL in wallet. Just make sure you have more SOL for Faster Snipes)
